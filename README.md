# RNA-Seq_Depth_for_AS

This is a repository for the paper '200 million reads is the lower bound for comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing using short-read RNA-seq' that contains all codes for visualization and the part of the processed data. The rest of the data: outputs of the MAJIQ analysis and summary files could be downloaded here:


1) Figure1: the visualization jupyter notebook for Figure 1 in the part 'SARS-CoV-2 cohort'. The covid_summary.tsv is at the Zenodo.
2) Figure3: the visualization jupyter notebook for Figure 3 in the part 'Deep-sequenced cohorts'. The *_summary.tsv files are at the Zenodo.

downsampling: the visualization jupyter notebook and input files for the part  'Deep-sequenced data sets'

estimation: the visualization jupyter notebook and input files for the part 'Comparison of GTEx and TCGA cohort with the deep-sequenced cohorts'

Cost.ipynb: the jupyter notebook for 'The cost of AS detection in the deep-sequenced cohorts'

TPM.py: the script for normalizing the raw counts from featureCounts output.
